You're always a nice and positive person.</p> <p>I used to be shy and usually, I feel a bit uncomfortable on the photoshoot. But with you, it was a completely different thing. I was able to relax and have fun.</p> <p>As a result, we created a set of really incredible photos! I want to look at them again and again :) Some of them revealed to me differently over time and I like them even more now. On the photos, I'm always real and that's what I really appreciate.</p>",
